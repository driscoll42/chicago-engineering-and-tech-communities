# Chicago Engineering and Tech Communities and Organizations

Inspired by [This Dot's Tech Community Slacks](https://github.com/thisdot/tech-community-slacks) but Chicago-focused! (However the [Awesome Tech Communities fork](https://github.com/MartinRosenberg/Awesome-Tech-Communities) is far more active and up to date than Dot's). 

This is a consolidated list of Slack, Discords, ect. of Chicago Engineering Communities and organizations. Please add add an issue if you think are missing or you want yours added! Please note that any added should be engineering/tech-focused and in Chicago, or at least have a substantial base in the Chicago subcommunity. For Meetups, they should have **in-person** Chicago events, rather than just being only online events with a "Chicago" chapter which exists to get in search listings. 

There is a great calendar of Chicago-based events which is posted here [Chicago Tech Community Events](https://chiirl.com/)).

## Online Chicago Communities

While the strong preference and focus of this page is to focus on in-person meetups, there is a place for slacks/discords/other of online groups focused in the Chicago region. To be in this section, there needs to be a specific focus on Chicago either on the entire commnunity, or at least a channel for Chicago. Many of these have requirements to join, e.g. you need to be invited, so you may need to attend an event in person first. 

#### Personal Favorites of @driscoll42

These are the ones that I (@driscoll42) enjoy the most, from a combination of amount of activity on the channels/apps and lack of spam. Some are less active than others on the list, but much of that "activity" can be a bit spammy. I admit that some of the others I just know less as it's an area that's not my focus so I encourage checking out all that interest you and make your own call.

- [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/education-and-research/academic-programs)

## Other

For other groups that are not directly engineering related, but I feel are worth bringing to the attention of engineers in Chicago.
