Angel investing is a way for smart, driven people, like MBAs to help support founders they believe in and ideas that want to see in the world while building a powerful network and investing track record.\n",
      "We'll look at how first checks can be as small as $1,000 (seriously!), how things like syndicates (think: team investing, like the Angel Squad we'll discuss) make it possible, and whether it makes sense to start during your program or after graduation.\n",
